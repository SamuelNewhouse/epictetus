        <h2>His Life</h2>
        <p>Few details about Epictetus's life are known, but these are the most well known and historically accepted:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Born in the ancient Greek city of Hierapolis around 50-60 C.E.</li>
          <li>Was a slave as a child.</li>
          <li>While still a slave, he studied philosophy under the great Stoic philosopher Musonius Rufus.</li>
          <li>Walked with a limp caused by either childhood abuse or joint illness (sources disagree on the cause.)
            <li>Attained freedom from slavery but was forced to leave the Italian peninusula in 89 C.E. when philosophers were
              banned by Emperor Domitian.</li>
            <li>Formed his own influential school in Nicopolis where he spent the rest of his life teaching and discoursing.</li>
            <li>Died around 135 C.E.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>His Influence</h2>
        <p>Epictetus's influence was substantial during his own time and continues to be so today.</p>

                  <li><em>"It is easy, indeed, to observe that Plato is found only in the hands of those who profess to be literary men; while Epictetus is admired by persons of ordinary capacity, who have a desire to be benefited, and who perceive the improvement which may be derived from his writings."</em></li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                  <li><em>"Right. Stoicism – a true stoic has no dilemmas... they came to Epictetus, and they told him the choice that he had – either death or shave off your beard – and they said, we’ll give you 24 hours to decide. He says, I don’t need 24 hours. He says, I’m not shaving it off. And they said, well, we’ll behead you. He said, go ahead; you do what you have to do, and I’ll do what I have to do; my body is only a bowl of clay with a quart of blood in it; and someday I’ve got to give it back anyway."</em></li>
                </ul>
              </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>His Quotes</h2>
        <p>Quotes from Epictetus can be found easily on the Internet. Here are a just a few of them:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>"What is the first business of one who practices philosophy? To get rid of self-conceit. For it is impossible for anyone to begin to learn that which he thinks he already knows."</em></li>
          <li><em>"When you do anything from a clear judgment that it ought to be done, never shun the being seen to do it, even though the world should make a wrong supposition about it; for, if you don’t act right, shun the action itself; but, if you do, why are you afraid of those who censure you wrongly?"</em></li>
          <li><em>"These reasonings are unconnected: “I am richer than you, therefore I am better”; “I am more eloquent than you, therefore I am better.” The connection is rather this: “I am richer than you, therefore my property is greater than yours;” “I am more eloquent than you, therefore my style is better than yours.” But you, after all, are neither property nor style."</em></li>
          <li><em>"It is the act of an ill-instructed man to blame others for his own bad condition; it is the act of one who has begun to be instructed, to lay the blame on himself; and of one whose instruction is completed, neither to blame another, nor himself."</em></li>
        </ul>
