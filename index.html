      <h2>His Life</h2>
      <p>Few details about Epictetus's life are known, but these are the most well known and historically accepted:</p>
      <ul id="tribute-info">
        <li>Born in the ancient Greek city of Hierapolis around 50-60 C.E.</li>
        <li>Was a slave as a child.</li>
        <li>While still a slave, he studied philosophy under the Stoic philosopher Musonius Rufus.</li>
        <li>Walked with a limp caused by either childhood abuse or joint illness (sources disagree on the cause.)
          <li>Attained freedom from slavery but was forced to leave the Italian peninusula in 89 C.E. when philosophers were
            banned by Emperor Domitian.</li>
          <li>Formed his own influential school in Nicopolis where he spent the rest of his life teaching and discoursing.</li>
          <li>Died around 135 C.E.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>His Influence</h2>
      <p>Epictetus's influence was substantial during his life and continues to be so today.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Origen Adamantius</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>One of the earliest and most influential Christian theologians</li>
            <li>
              <p>Believed Epictetus was more popular than Plato:</p>
              <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <p>It is easy, indeed, to observe that Plato is found only in the hands of those who profess to be literary
                  men; while Epictetus is admired by persons of ordinary capacity, who have a desire to be benefited, and
                  who perceive the improvement which may be derived from his writings.</p>

                <p>Right. Stoicism – a true stoic has no dilemmas... they came to Epictetus, and they told him the choice that
                  he had – either death or shave off your beard – and they said, we’ll give you 24 hours to decide. He says,
                  I don’t need 24 hours. He says, I’m not shaving it off. And they said, well, we’ll behead you. He said,
                  go ahead; you do what you have to do, and I’ll do what I have to do; my body is only a bowl of clay with
                  a quart of blood in it; and someday I’ve got to give it back anyway.</p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">
            <p>What is the first business of one who practices philosophy? To get rid of self-conceit. For it is impossible
              for anyone to begin to learn that which he thinks he already knows.</p>

            <p>When you do anything from a clear judgment that it ought to be done, never shun the being seen to do it, even
              though the world should make a wrong supposition about it; for, if you don’t act right, shun the action itself;
              but, if you do, why are you afraid of those who censure you wrongly?"</p>

            <p>These reasonings are unconnected: “I am richer than you, therefore I am better”; “I am more eloquent than you,
              therefore I am better.” The connection is rather this: “I am richer than you, therefore my property is greater
              than yours;” “I am more eloquent than you, therefore my style is better than yours.” But you, after all, are
              neither property nor style.</p>
